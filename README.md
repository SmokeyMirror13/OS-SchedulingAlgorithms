# OS-SchedulingAlgorithms

A scheduling algorithm is the algorithm which dictates how much CPU time is allocated to Processes and Threads. This project contains different scheduling algorithms and gives a in-depth comparision between them. We have implements threadPools and GUI in this project to help the performance as well UI.
